Machine Learning Classification

Problem

In this project, we are building classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.
we will load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. we will use following algorithms to build our models:

k-Nearest Neighbour

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine

Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index

F1-score

LogLoass
